# Android Jetpack Compose Demo Lazy Column

In Android Jetpack Compose, the equivalent of RecyclerView for creating a scrollable column with efficient item handling and recycling is the LazyColumn composable. It provides similar functionality to RecyclerView, such as handling large datasets, recycling and reusing item views, and efficiently rendering only the visible items on the screen.
